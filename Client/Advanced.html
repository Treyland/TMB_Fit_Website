        <h4>About this Program:</h4>
        <p>This program is designed to challenge the movement mechanics that were built in the beginner and intermediate programs.
          The progressions utilize weight and movement variations that will challenge the muscles and joints to move in mechanically sound positions under greater stress.
          This program is suited for people who are confident in their movement mechanics and have been working out consistently for a prolonged period of time.
          Although this program is designed to be physically taxing, it is important to maintain focus on your movement mechanics. 
          This program offers more freedom to choose how you would like to progress/how to perform some exercises. 
          This program can be completed using bodyweight, weighted resistance, or any combination of the two.  You will be responsible for making any changes to rep ranges, 
          based on the resistance you choose.  If you would like a more personal approach, we encourage you to schedule a consultation call with one of our trainers!
