        <h4>About this Program:</h4>
        <p>This program is designed to build upon the foundation set in the Beginner program.  The goal is to hone in on the movement mechanics and master
          them amidst some progressions of foundational movements.  Mastering these movements
          will allow us to move through our daily lives more safely and efficiently.  We will gain strength
          and our new mastery of our movement mechanics will help to keep us out of compromised positions.
          This program is suited for people who have been working out steadily or those who feel that 
          a "beginner" program will not be challenging enough.  This program can be completed using bodyweight, weighted resistance, or any combination of the two.  
          You will be responsible for making any changes to the rep ranges, based on the resistance you choose.  If you would like a more personal approach, we encourage you
          to schedule a consultation call with one of our trainers!
