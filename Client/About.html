        <h1>About Me - Trey Blanding</h1>
        <h2>ACE Certified Personal Trainer</h2>
        <h3>OCT 2019 - PRESENT</h3>
        <p>I have been an ACE Certified Personal Trainer since October of 2019.  Fitness has always played an important role in my life.
          I had aspirations to play college basketball at a young age and was fortunate to have a successful career at Hobart College! 
          I was blessed to have people in my life who stressed the important role that my strength, explosiveness, speed, and general fitness 
          would play in my long term success as a basketball player.  It wasn't until after graduation that I realized how important fitness 
          would be in my general life.  The summer following graduation, my brain was attacked by a virus that left me hospitalized and left me with
          long-term side effects that may never fade away.  I began a long road to recovery, grappling with a new normal.  I found it difficult to
          work out at all, which left me in an extremely unhealthy and vulnerable state.  My physical body grew weaker by the day and, perhaps even 
          more noticeable, my mental well-being deteriorated.  My support structure encouraged me to take it one step at a time and begin working out again.
          As a result, my body and my mind grew stronger and, in time, I regained my sense of self.  The body's scientific/bioligical response to training
          is very real and played a major role in saving my life.  Following my experience, I decided that I wanted to help others experience 
          those same benefits.  This led me to study for and pass the ACE CTP Certification Exam so that I could adequately and professionaly provide a quality
          fitness service to my clients.  My goal is to help guide people through their fitness journey, regardless of where they may find themselves.  
          From beginner to long-time fitness enthusiast, everyone deserves to be healthy and happy and it would be my pleasure to facilitate your journey!
