            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>"I already know what I am doing, what value can a trainer bring me?"

            <li>As with anything in life, there is always room for growth.  It may be the case that you've been working out for years and have hit a plateau that you can't seem to conquer. Maybe you are just looking to switch up your normal routine. Working with a trainer may give you that extra boost that you need.  Again, our mission is to help you take ownership of your fitness journey, so we can also serve as a resource to bounce ideas off of if you are already confident in your fitness.
