        <h4>About this Program:</h4>
        <p>This program is designed to introduce your body to training/working out and to introduce you to proper movement mechanics.
            The goal is for you to begin to reprogram your CNS (Central Nervous System) in order to move properly. 
            This program is suited for people who are new to working out or people who have taken a long break and are looking to get back into physical exercise.
            It is important that you pay special attention to your form and mechanics as you move through each movement.  I encourage you not to rush through any exercises in an effort to "get through" the workout.  Rather, you should move through each exercise with a nice, steady tempo (2-3 seconds down, short hold at bottom (Eccentric Isometrics)).
            This program can be completed using bodyweight, weighted resistance, or any combination of the two.  This allows you to be flexible with where and when you complete your workouts!
            You will be responsible for making any changes to the rep ranges, based on the resistance you choose.  This is to be used as a template for someone new to follow.
            If you would like a more personal approach, we encourage you to schedule a consultation call with one of our trainers!
